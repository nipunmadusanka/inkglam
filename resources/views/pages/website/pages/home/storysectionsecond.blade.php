                        For many people, tattoos are personal works of body art, so an off-the-shelf approach doesn’t
                        work for everyone. If you want to create your own tattoo, but aren’t an artist yourself, then
                        Custom Tattoo Design may be what you need because you can hire a tattoo designer. Starting with
                        a brief description of your design their team provides an estimate of the cost. After agreeing
                        on the estimate, you go onto select an artist to work on your design.
                        <br /><br />
                        Custom Tattoo Design (CTD) go out of their way to make sure you are happy with the end result.
                        Before you receive the final design, the artist sends you a rough sketch to approve.

                        Tattoo Ideas doesn’t feature interviews with tattooed celebrities. It doesn’t produce videos and
                        hasn’t got affiliations with big-name artists. Instead, they keep things simple and focus on the
                        tattoos themselves. The site is a gallery of user-submitted tattoo designs, body ink pics, and
                        some of the best tattoo ideas.
